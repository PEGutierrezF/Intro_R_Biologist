# What is R Programming?
- R is a free and open source software environment and programming language for statistics.

- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University
of Auckland (in New Zealand), and is based on the S language that
was created by John Chambers at Bell Laboratories.

# What is R Programming?
- When you download and install R, you get a collection of basic packages (and libraries) that can be used to implement several common data manipulations, graphical displays, and statistical models.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
* **Strengths:**  
-Free and Open Source.  
-Strong User Community.  
-Highly extensible, flexible.  
-Implementation of high-end statistical methods.  
-Flexible graphics and intelligent defaults.  

--

* **Weakness:**  
-Steep learning curve.  
-Slow for large datasets. 

---
# Why R?
- **Computing power**: R can handle much larger datasets than traditional programs, which is especially important for long-term ecological data, community science data, and public health data.

--

- **Flexibility & convenience**: Traditionally, scientists would need separate programs for data cleaning, statistical procedures, and data visualization.  
Learning R means you can do everything in a single program, and
customize to fit the goals of your project.

--

- **Reproducibility**: Saving your code as an R script makes it easy for other scientists to see what you did, and repeat your methods.

---
# R Overview

---
# How to download?
- Google it using R or CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)  
  - http://www.r-project.org

---
# How to download?
- Having installed R, the next thing we will want to do is install **RStudio**, a popular and useful interface for writing scripts and using R.

- If you google **RStudio** you will get to this window:  
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 

- Rstudio is an ***integrated development environment (IDE)*** for R that allows users to interact more easily with R by integrating different aspects of scripting, from code completion to debugging.

# Typical Rstudio session

.pull-left[
- **Code Editor**: Contains code to tell R what to do.  
- Save scripts for future use.

# Typical Rstudio session

.pull-left[
- **Console**: output & temporary input - usually unsaved.

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/Rstudio.png")
```
]

---
# Typical Rstudio session

.pull-left[
- **Workspace**: Stores objects created during the session.  Save with save.image().
- **History**: Records commands used.  Save with savehistory().
]

# Typical Rstudio session

.pull-left[
- **Plots**: Displays graphs.  Save plots with ggsave().
- **Files**: Shows files in the working directory.
